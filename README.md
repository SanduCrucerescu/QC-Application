# Qt-Application
This app was created during an intership at an IT company. The app was creaded using C++, MySQL, and for the design Qt creator. The app purpose it to manage the products in a store. As a user we have the posibility to log in, at first we see all the products in the store, the buttons on the left gives us the posibility to add a new product, modify an existing one, to delet it or to add them to a basket if anything was bought and export a receipt. The app is pretty simple and unfortunately it is only in Romanian.
